# How to run
To run the backend, you need to have the required .json files!

Once you have these: 
1) `cd backend && pip3 install -r requirements.txt && python3 send_movement.py`
2) In a separate terminal: `cd frontent && npm install && ng serve`
3) Open [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and see the magic!
